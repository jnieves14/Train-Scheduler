# Train-Scheduler

## Overview
This assignment incorporates a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
